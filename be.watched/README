BE:Watched
----------

BE::Watched is a generic inode/dbus -> process/dbus wrapper.
It listens to file updates or DBus signals of random services and in return lauches a process or calls a dbus function.

To edit the configuration run

    be.watched edit

This will open the configuration in your preferred text editor.
NOTICE that BE::Watched listens to changes to that file and reconfigures itself automatically.

Explanatory config example:
---------------------------

# The comma separated list of filewatch configurations
Files=Test1,Test2
# The comma separated list of dbus signal hooks
DBusSignals=Test3,Test4

# The first filewatch configuration
[Test1]
File=/foo/bar # an absolute path to the file to watch - NO SHELL ALIASES (like "~" or "$HOME")
Exec=xterm # if /foo/bar gets touched (or removed/readded) BE::Watched will launch an xterm

# The second filewatch configuration
[Test2]
File=/foo/bar
# lets make touching that file toggling the compositor, shall we? =)
DBus=session,org.kde.KWin,/Compositor,org.kde.kwin.Compositing,toggleCompositing

# "session" or "system" specify the Bus to listen to (system contains eg. Udisks/2, Upower, Networkmanager etc.)
# "org.kde.KWin" is the service to address (the list you get when typing "qdbus")
# "/Compositor" is the path inside the service ("qdbus org.kde.KWin" prints a list)
# "org.kde.kwin.Compositing" is the interface, ie. the function "prefix"
#            (watch it closely because there can be several in one path)
# "toggleCompositing" is the dbus member to call
#
# BE::Shell users BE AWARE that the comma instead of the semicolon is correct!
#                                  QSettings does not parse beyond semicolons.



# The first dbus hook, it's now getting more complex
[Test3]
# first, bus, service, path and interface determining the dbus target - you know that from above
Bus=session
Service=org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver
Path=/ScreenSaver
Interface=org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver
# Next is the Signal to listen to
Signal=ActiveChanged
# Now comes the Signature - this is IMPORTANT - if it does not match the real thing, nothing is gonna happen
Signature=b # this one means "boolean" because the screensaver emits true or false
# For the dbus types see here: http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#type-system
# The most important ones are "b", "i", "u", "d", "s" (bool, integer, unsigned integer, double, string)
Exec=kdialog -passivepopup "ScreenSaver active: %1" 0

# This will get you a notification about the screensaver state when it toggles.
# Notice the "%1" - it is replaced by the first (and in this case only) signal variable

# The second dbus hook, you're almost done
[Test4]
Bus=session
Service=org.kde.KWin
Path=/Compositor
Interface=org.kde.kwin.Compositing
Signal=compositingToggled
Signature=b
# The above listens to the compositor
DBus=session,org.kde.yakuake,/yakuake/MainWindow_1,org.qtproject.Qt.QWidget,setVisible,%1
# and toggles yakuake with the compositor
# (after the function follows a list of arguments and "%1" is replaced by the Signal value)
