BE::Shell is a simple desktop shell on KDE technology (namely KIO and Solid) for the rest of us.

The focus is on control and understanding.

Therefore the very first thing you get after you succeeded Installation is the void.

read here: (really - the installation process is not fully automated; you're shall understand your setup)
https://sourceforge.net/p/be-shell/wiki/Installation/

Ok, you do get a desktop window and if you figure how to use your right mouse button, you're ready
to start constructing your desktop (that means: "with an editor", so better attach your keyboard)

To get a usable desktop shell - /your/ desktop shell - you'll have to edit the Configuration
(or borrow someone elses, maybe you found the example folder)

...and here: (well, in case you're interestend in anything beyond the void)

Once you have laid out your desktop, you maybe want to control it's look via Qss Theming

...and finally here: (to have your artistical dreams come true)

That's it.
Have Fun
